# Ocean-Acidification-and-Deadzone-Visualization-on-Marine-ecosystem

Overview

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing ocean dead zones and ocean acidification using data-driven approaches. Ocean dead zones are areas with low oxygen levels that make it difficult for marine life to survive. Ocean acidification refers to the decreasing pH levels in seawater due to increased CO2 absorption, which negatively impacts marine ecosystems. The project includes pH level analysis and other relevant parameters to identify potential dead zones and acidification trends.

Features

pH Level Analysis: Determines ocean acidity levels.

Data Processing & Visualization: Parses and visualizes oceanographic data.

Dead Zone Identification: Uses predefined thresholds to classify affected regions.

Ocean Acidification Monitoring: Tracks changes in pH levels over time.

Smart Monitoring: Implements algorithms for real-time analysis and decision-making.
